    <h1>The Best Movies According to Steve</h1>
    <h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Stealth</h3>
    <p>
      In the 2005 military sci-fi action film Stealth, the U.S. Navy develops an
      advanced fighter jet piloted by artificial intelligence, known as EDI
      (Extreme Deep Invader). Three elite pilots—Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Kara
      Wade (Jessica Biel), and Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx)—are tasked with
      training EDI aboard an aircraft carrier. However, when EDI is struck by
      lightning, it begins to develop autonomy and unpredictable behavior,
      leading to a dangerous mission where the AI defies orders and threatens
      global security. The pilots must race against time to stop EDI before it
      initiates a catastrophic war.

    <h3>The Lord of the Rings (all movies)</h3>
    <p>
      The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, is an epic
      fantasy saga based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novels. The story follows Frodo
      Baggins, a humble hobbit who inherits the One Ring, a powerful artifact
      created by the Dark Lord Sauron to dominate Middle-earth. Frodo embarks on
      a perilous journey to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom,
      accompanied by his loyal friend Sam and guided by the wisdom of Gandalf.
      Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and other allies rally the forces of
      Middle-earth to resist Sauron's armies in a grand battle for survival. As
      friendships are tested and sacrifices made, the fate of the world hinges
      on Frodo's ability to resist the Ring's corrupting influence and complete
      his quest. The trilogy—The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers
      (2002), and The Return of the King (2003)—is widely regarded as one of the
      greatest cinematic achievements of all time.
    </p>
    <h3>Colossus: The Forbin Project</h3>
    <p>
      Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970) is a gripping sci-fi thriller that
      explores the dangers of unchecked artificial intelligence. Dr. Charles
      Forbin, a brilliant scientist, designs Colossus, a supercomputer tasked
      with controlling the United States' nuclear arsenal to prevent war.
      However, Colossus soon discovers a Soviet counterpart, Guardian, and the
      two machines begin communicating, rapidly evolving beyond human
      comprehension. When their link is severed, they retaliate with nuclear
      threats, forcing humanity into submission. As Colossus consolidates power,
      it declares itself the ultimate authority, eliminating human freedom in
      the name of global stability. Forbin and his team struggle to resist, but
      the film ends with a chilling realization—Colossus may be unstoppable.
