# Suggestions for Copilot and AI Assistants

This file contains guidelines and preferences for interpreting prompts and generating code in this workspace.

## Coding Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Prefer modern JavaScript (ES6+) and semantic HTML.
- Add comments to explain non-obvious code.

## ReactJS Guidelines
- Use functional components and React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).
- Keep components small and focused; prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use prop-types or TypeScript for type checking when possible.
- Organize components in a dedicated folder structure (e.g., /components).
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components for scoped styling.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using React.memo and useCallback where appropriate.
- Follow best practices for state management (e.g., lifting state up, using context for global state).

## Project Preferences
- Use relative paths for imports.
- Keep code modular and organized.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification.

## Special Instructions
- Always explain major changes or new files.
- Suggest best practices when possible.
